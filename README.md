## Single Head Encoder to Multihead Attention decoder.
Shallower architecture than the previous one, encoding the concatenated faraday cup and magnetometer vectors into a low dimensional space for multihead attention posprocessing, then these sequences are newly analyzed by a Recurrent Neural Network to output the prediction.[Explanatory video]()
